# Overview

Except displaying sets of data, Telerik's RadDataGrid also allows you to execute an [Edit operation]({%slug datagrid-editing-editoperation%}).

RadDataGrid also supports Data Validation out of the box.

>Besides using this functionality, you are able to control it via the several commands that provide an entry point for the key-points of the action:

* [BeginEdit Command]({%slug datagrid-commands-editingcommands-begineditcommand%})
* [CancelEdit Command]({%slug datagrid-commands-editingcommands-canceleditcommand%})
* [CommitEdit Command]({%slug datagrid-commands-editingcommands-commiteditcommand%})
