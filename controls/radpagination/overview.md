# Overview

>RadPagination is available for Windows 8.1.

Thank you for using RadPagination for Windows Universal!

RadPagination is a navigation control that is designed to add new features to XAML ItemsControls such as FlipView.
It allows current page tracking and previous, next and exact page navigation.
It is appropriate to use it in your application with any ItemsControls for more features and much more detailed visualization.


It is composed of three elements:

* Next and Previous navigation buttons
* List of items
* Current Index label

Here's a snapshot of a standard RadPaginationControl used with ItemsControl:
