# Overview

>RadRating is available for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1.
 
The RadRating control provides the end-user with the ability to evaluate something by choosing from a range of rating items associated with a given value. The selection happens, when one of the rating items is tapped or by applying a pan gesture over the rating items.
