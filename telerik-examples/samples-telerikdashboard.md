# Dashboard

The **Telerik Dashboard** sample app shows you how to use Telerik UI for Universal Windows Platform Charts and Gauges in a real use-case scenario to bring data to end-users in an appealing and meaningful way.

The application visualizes statistic data about various economic factors in a number of countries and allows comparison between these countries' values. Included are various Telerik controls, serving two main purposes - visualizing data and filtering the parameters for the displayed statistics.

## Goals

The Telerik Dashboard application displays some real-world usages of the data visualization and list controls from the Universal Windows Platform suite. It includes:

* [CartesianChart(LineSeries) ]({%slug radchart-cartesianchart-series-categorical-lineseries%}) visualizing GDP per capita statistics for each chosen country.
* [CartesianChart(AreaSeries) ]({%slug radchart-cartesianchart-series-categorical-areaseries%}) visualizing GPD per capita statistics for one country.
* [CartesianChart(BarSeries) ]({%slug radchart-cartesianchart-series-categorical-barseries%}) displaying the value added to GDP by services, manufacturing and agriculture.
* [PieChart(PieSeries) ]({%slug radchart-series-pieseries%}) displaying the value added to GDP by services, manufacturing and agriculture for one country.
* [Radial Gauge]({%slug radgauge-gauges-radialgauge%}) showing the total tax rate in the chosen countries.
* [BulletGraph]({%slug bulletgraph-overview%}) used to display the "ease of doing business" index of each chosen country/ies.
